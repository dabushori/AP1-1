In this exercise I developed a matrix system. This system have a few methods:  
* matrix creating  
* matrix copying  
* matrix destroying  
* get height and width  
* set and get value  
* matrices addition  
* matrices multiplication  
* matrix multiplication by scalar  

The matrix is implemented by a struct that contains a 2D array od doubles and height and width parameters.

In addition, there's an error system, which shows if a method succeeded or failed.  

I checked my code using the main that was given and a few more tests.
